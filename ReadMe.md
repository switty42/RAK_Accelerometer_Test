# RAK Accelerometer Test
Docs 6-10-23 V1 (For questions or comments:  Stephen Witty switty@level500.com)  

### Project Overview:
This project is a simple investigation of RAK WisBlock accelerometer capability.  As a base it uses sample code from RAK that can be found here:

https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK1904/Quickstart/#software-configuration-and-example

Modifications were made to blink the built-in green LED when movement is detected.  Raw accelerometer values are also displayed via the serial port. 


This project should be considered demo/POC quality.
